Let f(x) be the expected result of the game

f(x):
if x > t:
    x
else:
    5/6*f(x+1)


This evaluates to

f(0) = t*p^t



Substitute:
    y = t-x   =>   x = t-y



f(t-y):
if 0 > y:
    t-y
else:
    5/6*f(t-y+1)









Goal: figure out when to stop to maximize expected value
in other words, find t that optimizes f(0)


f(x) = 5/6*f(x+1)
f(100) = 100
